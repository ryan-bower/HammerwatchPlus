# fishing

Fishing along the town's coast, a pirate who sells bait, rods and fish traps,
fishing spots in the water of run floors' potion wells (always one in a boss room),
and fish that sell for the Gambler's bet tokens or fight as swords.

- **Coast spots.** Six `doodads/hwp/fishing_spot.unit` along the town's west
  coast (the `water_coastline` pieces of `prefabs/town/segments/base.lvl`).
  Every machine spawns its own copies (`netsync="none"`), so each player fishes
  locally. A spot shows only its two swimming fish; the rod sprite that stood on
  the sand went on 2026-10-22 (the user's call), the rod stays as the interact
  icon. Interacting opens the minigame: **Cast** (costs one of the bait on
  your hook; the **Bait** button cycles the kinds you have), wait
  0.8-3 s for a bite, then press **Reel** (button, Enter or gamepad confirm)
  while the sweeping marker is inside the green zone. The zone shrinks and the
  marker speeds up with the fish tier: 40 / 26 / 16 / 10 px of the 240 px
  bar, 0.18 / 0.23 / 0.28 / 0.34 px per ms; the marker counts as soon as it
  touches the zone. It is drawn every frame between game ticks at sub-pixel
  positions, so it glides instead of stepping.
- **Fish are swords.** The catch goes into your bag (or drops at your feet when
  the bag is full) as `hwp_fish_<id>` from `tweak/hwp/fishing_items.sval`: a
  main-hand weapon that swings like the longsword (`attack_swing_longsword`,
  Perch 28-34 up to Abyssal Eel 50-60 physical), excluded from random loot.
  It carries the `mods_weapon_mainhand(_melee)` tags, so the enchanter can
  upgrade it (commons) and enchant it (uncommon and rare fish) like any
  weapon. A 2-star (uncommon) fish is caught with one modifier and a 3-star
  (rare) one with two, rolled like dropped gear of that quality and level
  (`Equipment::Generator.GenerateItemMods`); the enchanter needs them (it reads
  the quality's modifier slots and broke on a 2/3-star fish without any).
  1-star fish have none. Its **item level** is set where it was caught: town
  fish are ilvl 1 / 5 / 10 / 15 by tier (1-star fish 1-5); a run catch uses the
  floor's drop level (`g_diffLevel`, which includes NG+, +-1, capped at your
  drop level cap), like gear.
- **Stars and bet tokens.** Fish are 1, 2 or 3 star (tiers 1-2, 3, 4) and sell
  for 1 / 3 / 5 **bet tokens** (`HWP::Market` token price; the pirate's Sell
  button, `hwp fishing sell`, the Gambler's Sell button or `hwp sell`). Only
  unworked fish in the bag sell: each catch stores its signature (base id,
  item level, quality, modifiers in order) in your HWP save data
  (`market_sigs`, core `HWP::Market::Remember`); enchanting, upgrading or
  rerolling a fish changes it, so it stays in the bag as gear. 1-star fish with
  no modifiers always count. Older saves: 2/3-star fish caught without
  modifiers get them rolled (and stay wares) the first time you are in town.
  The Gambler rerolls gear for 1 token per 5 item levels. Town water only has
  1-star fish; star fish (2+) bite only in the second half of a run's floors,
  and boss rooms have only 3-star fish. The host announces each catch.
- **Fish traps.** The pirate sells up to 3 (500 / 1000 / 2000 g). They sit in
  the water off three of the coast spots (`fish_trap.unit`, `fish_trap_full.unit` with a fish
  and a map icon once something is inside). The time you spend on a run is
  counted (`fishing.run_ms`, flushed every 5 s); back in town every 10 minutes
  of it gives each trap a 50 % chance of +1 fish, up to 3 per trap. Walk up
  to a trap to empty it into your bag. `hwp fishing traps` lists them.
- **Rods.** Per character (`fishing.rod` in your HWP save data). A new
  character has none: the slot is empty and Cast says to buy one. The pirate
  sells Driftwood (100 g), Sturdy (400 g), Sea (1200 g) and Captain's (3000 g),
  in that order. A character saved before rods were sold (it fished, ran or
  levelled before its first look, `fishing.rod_v`) keeps a free Driftwood.
  Each tier past Driftwood widens the catch
  zone by 20 %, slows the marker by 10 % and raises the odds of rare and epic
  fish. The rod shows in the character screen's gear grid (core
  `hwp-gear-rod` slot) with its bonuses and your bait, in its tier's colour
  (`gui/hwp/rods.png`: grey driftwood, brown sturdy, teal sea, gold and red
  captain's). Debug: `hwp fishing rod <tier>`.
- **The pirate fisherman** (`doodads/hwp/pirate_fisher.unit`, interact class
  `HWPPirateShop`) sits on the half-buried boat next to the trading post's
  "Trade materials" NPC and talks like a pirate. He sells worms (5 for 50 g,
  20 for 180 g), shrimp (5 for 400 g), glow squid (3 for 900 g) and the next
  rod. The bait decides the coast's star range: worms 1-2, shrimp 2-3, squid
  3-4 (`BAIT_MIN_TIER`/`BAIT_MAX_TIER`); the rod's bonuses roll within it.
  Each kind is a cell in the materials tab's Supplies section with a tooltip.
  At trading post tier 3 (its last) the wreck becomes a whole boat and he stands
  in it (`ON_BOAT_X/Y`, 2 px below the boat's origin in that tier's prefab: the hull is
  drawn sorted by that origin and would hide him any higher up). His
  spot is taken from the material trader's position; a building upgrade rebuilds the
  town and removes him, so the coast is placed again within a second.
  `hwp set fishing.pirate_x/y` put him anywhere. He has an anchor merchant
  icon on the map (`gui/hwp/map_pirate.png`).
- **Run spots.** On `fishing.run_chance` % of floors (default 30) the host
  places `fishing_hole_well.unit` on one of the floor's potion-refill wells,
  with its fish swimming in the well's water (levels have no reachable open
  water). Only a well with room to stand beside it is used. The unit has one
  scene per well kind (`WELL_KIND`: well, dark halls, barrel, crypt, fountain).
  While the well can still refill potions, using it refills first
  (`HWPFishingHoleNPC` usable priority 1). Its water stays in the spot once the
  well is drained. A boss room always gets one: at its well, or a fishing bucket
  (`fishing_bucket.unit`, a small fish in the bucket) beside the host when it
  has none. Once a player has used all their casts on the floor, the spot shows
  no fish and its map icon greys out, as a used well's does. Each machine does
  this for its own player, `WatchHoles`. No bait is needed. Each player gets `fishing.run_casts`
  (3) casts per floor: casting asks the host (`fishing.cast` with the rod
  tier), who counts the cast, rolls the tier within the floor's star range and
  answers `fishing.bite` or `fishing.denied`. Reeling in sends
  `fishing.catch`: the host spawns `hwp_fishing_run_<tier>` loot and sends the
  catcher `fishing.landed` (fish + item level) for the fish itself.
- Fishing spots, holes and full traps show a fish icon on the minimap
  (`gui/hwp/map_icons.png` from core, made by `tools/make_map_icons.py`).
- `fishing.*` settings are host-synced; `fishing.coast 0` removes the coast
  spots and the pirate. `hwp fishing buy bait|bait20|shrimp|squid|rod|trap` buys from the
  console. With `fishing.debug 1`: `hwp fishing hole` (host), `hwp fishing wells`
  (host, in a run: every well kind with a spot in it, plus a bucket), `hwp fishing
  catch [tier]`, `hwp fishing bait <worm|shrimp|squid> [n]`, `hwp fishing traps <minutes>` (fill
  the traps as if back from a run that long).

## Test checklist

1. `python -m gamelab run mod-fishing --mode lab`: `[HWP:fishing] self-check done: 8 fish, 0 missing items`, no
   script issues.
2. Town: six rod + fish spots along the west beach, the pirate on the boat by
   the trading post. `hwp fishing` shows the spot count and his position.
3. Pirate: greeting in pirate speak, buy bait (gold drops, bait rises), buy a
   rod with too little gold (refused), then with enough. Status updates live.
4. Coast cast without bait: refused. The Bait button cycles worms / shrimp /
   squid (only kinds you have); squid catches only 3-4 star fish. With bait: the marker sweeps the bar
   (it moves), a hit puts the fish in your bag, a miss says "It got away"; each
   cast costs one bait. Full bag: the fish drops on the ground.
5. Equip a fish: it swings like a sword; its tooltip shows the item level.
   Take an uncommon fish to the enchanter: upgrade and enchant work (Enchant
   lists the modifiers your town has blueprints for), also on a fresh 2/3-star
   fish. Sell fish at the pirate, the Gambler and with `hwp sell`: they leave
   the bag and the bet tokens rise by 1 / 3 / 5 per star; an enchanted or
   upgraded fish stays.
6. Character screen: the rod slot (bottom left of the 3x3 gear grid) shows the
   rod's name, bonuses and bait in its tooltip.
7. 2-player lobby: both see their own spots and pirate; a catch is announced
   to the other player.
8. Run: a fishing spot in a well's water on some floors (fish icon on the map);
   catch 3 times -> loot and a fish of the floor's item level, the 4th cast is
   refused. First-half floors give 1-star fish only, boss rooms 3-star only
   (at the well or a bucket). A client gets the refusal as a chat line. Once
   the casts are used up, the spot has no fish and its map icon is greyed.
   `hwp fishing wells`: a fish sits in each kind of well's water and in the
   bucket. `mod-fishing-spots` measures this, and the pirate on the wreck at
   trading post tier 1 and in the boat at tier 3.
9. Traps: buy 1-3 at the pirate (prices rise, 4th refused); after a run of
   20+ minutes some traps show a fish; walk up to one: its fish go to the bag.
   `fishing.debug 1`, `hwp fishing traps 60` fills them without a run.
10. `fishing.enabled 0`: spots and pirate cannot be used.
