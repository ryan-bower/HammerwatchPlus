# classes

The three Heroes of Hammerwatch 1 classes that HoH2 lacks, on the class
pipeline the Firearms Specialist built (`PlayerClass`, `ItemSkillDef`,
`BaseItem`, `PlayerPortraitPiece`, `HeroTitle` loaders) plus a module that
self-checks the loaders and answers `hwp classes`. All numbers live in the
skill svals' `binds`.

Art: the committed `players/hwp/<class>/icons.png` (skill icons) and
`class_showcase.png` (create-character class icon) are placeholders.
`tools/import_hoh1.py classes` makes the real ones from your HoH1 install
(the HoH1 skill icons, and the HoH1 sprite facing the camera in default HoH1
dyes) into the gitignored `hoh1art/`, which `build.py --with-local` packs in
their place (`local_overlay`). The skills that are new here borrow a fitting
HoH1 icon (the table is `HOH1_SKILL_ICONS` in the tool).

Echoes of Hammerwatch I (formerly HoH1 Remastered; designed in the planner, `planner/data/*/<cls>-hoh1*`): a 5th
spec for each vanilla class, built from that class's HoH1 abilities HoH2 lacks
(the Rogue's from the HoH1 Thief, the Warrior's from the Gladiator). Nothing in
game uses it yet. Its icons are
`players/hwp/remastered/icons.png`: the committed placeholder
(`tools/make_remastered_icons.py`) has a shape in each cell of
`HOH1_REMASTERED_ICONS` in `tools/import_hoh1.py`, and `import_hoh1.py classes`
copies HoH1's whole `gui/icons_skills.png` over it in `hoh1art/` (same 256x256
layout, so a skill keeps its HoH1 rect).

## Thief (`hwp_thief`, rogue panel, starts with twin daggers)
HoH1 stats scaled to HoH2 (90 hp, 40 mana, 2 armor, dex 10).
- Base: **Throwing Knives** (fan of the rogue's knives), **Grappling Hook**
  (the vanilla rogue skill file, reused as-is), **Smoke Bomb** (blind +
  slow area), **Sidestep** (evade).
- Assassin: Vicious Cuts (crit chance + crit damage), Shadow Strike (leap
  with damage + minor stun), Backstab (crits add bleed stacks).
- Trickster: Slice and Dice (6 s +30 % attack speed self-buff), Caltrops
  (damage + slow + bleed area), Quick Hands (attack speed).
- Shadow: Cloak of Shadows (2.5 s 100 % evade + speed), Poisoned Blades
  (hit trigger poison damage), Vanish (hurt trigger cloak, 8 s timeout).

## Gladiator (`hwp_gladiator`, paladin panel, starts with the Arena Trident)
130 hp, 40 mana, 6 armor, str 10. **Arena Trident** (`hwp_trident_01`,
`tweak/hwp/equipment_classes.sval`) is a mainhand on the longsword model
with our copy of the unused vanilla spear thrust (`hwp_attack_trident`,
`players/hwp/gladiator/attacks_gladiator.sval`); it sits in the armory
pool.
- Base: **Net** (immobilize area), **Gladius Throw** (the warrior's
  returning whirling axe projectile), **Pit Fighters** (passive summon of
  the priest's crusader pikeman), **Planned Attack** (weapon damage).
- Champion: Riposte (thorns), Arena Mastery (armor + health), Shield Wall
  (5 s +50 % armor/resist self-buff).
- Beastmaster: Arena Beast (the ranger's wolf as a passive summon), Pack
  Leader (+1/+2 beasts), Bloodlust (kills heal).
- Retiarius: Barbed Net (damage + bleed + immobilize), Trident Whirl
  (melee explode around you, weapon damage), Trident Mastery (flat
  physical damage).

## Witch Hunter (`hwp_witch_hunter`, ranger panel, starts with a crossbow)
100 hp, 60 mana, 3 armor, 10 fire res. The start crossbow is `hwp_crossbow_01`
(`tweak/hwp/equipment_classes.sval`): ilvl 1 with a DEX requirement, since the vanilla
`twohanded_crossbow_01` needs 10 STR and was refused at character creation.
- Base: **Searing Torch** (hit trigger fire damage), **Pyre** (spawns
  `players/hwp/witchhunter/units/pyre.unit`: a stationary player-team
  unit on the decoy template that explodes fire around it every second
  for 8 s), **Hound** (wolf passive summon), **Ward of Branding** (fire +
  vulnerability area).
- Inquisitor: Fanatic Zeal (attack + spell crit), Murder of Crows (damage
  + blind area), Judgement (kills restore mana).
- Pyromancer: Brand (flat fire damage), Immolation (8 s self-buff: fire
  damage add + 10 % damage), Cinders (spell hits break armor).
- Hunter: Pack (+1/+2 hounds), Silver Bolts (flat physical), Tracker
  (move speed).

Self-buffs are `ActorBuffDef` dicts in `tweak/hwp/buffs_classes.sval`,
applied through a radius-8 self `Explode` with `ApplyBuff` (the same
trick the Firearms Reload uses for `GivePercentageMana`).

Morning decisions: all numbers, real icons/portraits (portrait pieces
reuse rogue / paladin / ranger), whether the Gladiator should be two-handed,
and which skills
should be spells vs passives.

## Extra skill keys (Skill 4-6)

The game has three skill buttons and gives the 3rd and every later active spell Skill3,
so they would all fire on one press. The Assassin and the Shadow have 4 actives, the
Trickster 5 and the Retiarius 4 (every other class and spec, in this mod or another, has
at most 3). `scripts/HWP/Classes/SkillKeys.as` gives the 4th, 5th and 6th active their own
raw key: Plus tab rows `skill4`-`skill6`, settings `skillkeys.skill4`-`6`, default the 4, 5,
6 keys (vanilla binds 1 2 3 Q E V).

- It runs on hwplib's targeting helper (`mods/hwplib/scripts/HWP/Core/TargetHelper.as`):
  `HWP::TargetHelper::OnUpdate` polls the keys, `OnSkillInput` gives each extra skill its
  key's state. The vanilla targeting code then serves them like any skill button, and
  Skill3 fires only the 3rd.
- Keys are ignored while a text field or the chat has the keyboard, and on the Plus tab.
- `SkillKeysHUD.as`: `HWPSkillKeysHUDPlayer` replaces the HUD's player bar, with more than
  four skill slots and the extra key's name above each extra skill.
- Keyboard only (no gamepad buttons are left). `hwp skillkeys` lists the keys and what
  each casts.
- GameLab: `gl input ... hwp_skill4` holds the key (GlobalCache `hwp_skillkeys_held`;
  gamelab-hands uses it while GlobalCache `hwp_skillkeys_on` is "1").
  `gamelab/bots/plan_classesb.py` checks `slice_own_button`, `cloak_own_button` and
  `charge_own_button`.

## Test checklist

1. `python -m gamelab run mod-classes --mode lab`: `[HWP:classes] self-check done: 3/3 classes`, no "has N
   subclasses" errors, no missing unit/item lines, no sval errors.
2. Character creation lists Thief, Gladiator and Witch Hunter with the
   generated icons; each spawns with its starting weapon.
3. Thief: knives fan out and hit, grappling hook pulls you, smoke bomb
   blinds, the Sidestep tooltip shows the evade chance.
4. Gladiator: the trident thrusts (damage numbers), net roots enemies, the
   gladius returns, a pit fighter follows you after ~20 s.
5. Witch Hunter: the pyre appears and burns enemies next to it for 8 s, a
   hound follows, the ward leaves enemies vulnerable.
6. Reach the subclass pick for each: three masteries each; the self-buff
   skills show the buff icon on the HUD for the listed duration.
7. Co-op: a client sees the host's pyre, hounds and knives and vice versa.

## Removed: the Priest and Paladin "HoH1" masteries (2026-10-20)

A 4th subclass for the vanilla Priest (Smiter: Smite, Divine Hammer, Last Rites) and
Paladin (Holy Storm: Holy Storm, Shield of Faith, Zealous Charge) used to live in
`players/hwp/hoh1specs/`. They were removed at the owner's request: only Smite was a real
HoH1 Priest skill, the rest were new (`docs/RE_NOTES.md`, 2026-10-20). Their 4th specs are
designed in the class planner instead. A character that took one no longer loads
(`PlayerRecord.Load` finds no class); no release ever shipped them.
