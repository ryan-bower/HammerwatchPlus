# weaponswap

Two weapon sets per character, toggled with a hotkey.

- The set in your hands is equipped normally; the other set (one main-hand +
  one off-hand item) is serialized with `Item::SaveItem` into your HWP save
  data (keys `weaponswap.main` / `weaponswap.off`, the active set number in
  `weaponswap.set`), so it follows the character through saves and can never
  duplicate an item.
- **X** (SDL scancode 27, polled with `IsKeyDown`) starts a **2 s swap
  channel** (`CHANNEL_MS`): a bar fills and a rooting buff holds you still.
  X again or a dodge (the Dash key, or a dash under way) cancels it and nothing
  changes. When it ends the sets swap: the held pair goes
  into the store, the stored pair is equipped through the vanilla
  `EquippedItems` (which syncs `PlayerEquipmentEquip/Unequip` to the lobby and
  refreshes modifiers and skills). Set 2 starts empty, so the first swap leaves
  your hands empty; equip the second set from your bag, then X flips between
  the two.
- Requirement checks (`MayEquip`) run before anything is unequipped; an item
  you can no longer wield stays in the store and you are told. Equip checks
  again without the pair just taken off (its stats may have been what made
  the other weapon wieldable); a refused item stays stored, and a weapon that
  cannot go back into your hands goes to the bag, so nothing is ever lost.
  With both sets empty a swap does nothing ("Both weapon sets are empty").
- 1 s cooldown (the hotkey and clicking an alt slot); ignored while dead,
  paused, typing in chat or in a menu. A solo game pauses behind the
  character menu; the channel runs there too, so a swap clicked in the menu
  lands in it.
- **Character screen:** the other set shows in two `hwp-gear-slot` widgets
  (hwplib `HWP::Gear`, ids `hwp-alt-main` / `hwp-alt-off`) next to the 3x3 gear
  grid. A two-hander's off-hand slot mirrors the main hand, dimmed. Click a
  slot (or press X) to swap; the tooltip shows the stored item or how to use it.
- **HUD tip:** while you are empty-handed with weapons in the other set, an
  on-screen line says to press X.
- **Rebinding:** player menu > **Plus** tab > "Swap weapons": click the
  button, then press the new key (Esc cancels); the key name is shown on the
  button and in the HUD tip. The game's Controls list cannot take it: its
  actions are a fixed table in the exe. A key you bind is ignored until you
  let go of it, so binding does not swap.
- Commands: `hwp swap`, `hwp swapkey` (show), `hwp swapkey 21 R` (set
  scancode + label), `hwp swapdrop` (other set back to the inventory if it
  fits).

## Settings

On the HammerwatchPlus tab of the player menu (Quality of Life > Wep. swap):

- **On/off** `weaponswap.enabled` (default on, the host's value in a lobby). Off: the key
  does nothing, a channel under way is cancelled, the alt slots, their labels and the HUD tip
  go away and `hwp swap` says it is off. The other set stays stored in the save as it was,
  so turning it back on finds it; `hwp swapdrop` still moves it to your bag. After turning
  it back on the alt slots return the next time the character menu opens.
- **Swap weapons** (option `swapkey`): the hotkey, rebound as above (`weaponswap.key`,
  `weaponswap.keyname`; your own).

## Test checklist

1. `python -m gamelab run mod-weaponswap --mode lab`: no script errors; `hwp swap` twice logs `set 2 in hand` /
   `set 1 in hand`.
2. Solo: press X with a sword -> hands empty, the sword shows in the alt slot
   of the character screen, the HUD tip appears. Equip a bow, press X -> sword
   back, bow in the alt slot; each swap takes 2 s standing still. X during
   the channel, or a dodge, cancels it ("Swap cancelled"), the weapons stay.
3. Click the alt main-hand slot in the character screen: the sets swap.
4. Save and reload: the alt slots still show the other set; swap works.
5. A two-hander in the other set: the alt off-hand slot mirrors it, dimmed.
6. Plus tab: click "Swap weapons", press R: the button says R, R swaps, X
   does not (`mod-options-tab` covers the rebind). `hwp swapkey 21 R` does the same. `hwp swapdrop`: items land in
   the inventory, the alt slots empty.
7. Co-op: the other player sees your weapon change on swap.
