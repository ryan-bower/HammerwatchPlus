// Floor items before vendors. Player.GetTopUsable takes the first usable in m_usables that
// CanUse, and AddUsable keeps that list sorted by UsePriority, lowest first
// (Behaviors/Actors/Player/Player.as:135-167). A dropped item is 1 (Items/UnitBehavior.as:299)
// and NPCs, shops, chests and shrines are 0, so an item lying at a vendor's feet could not be
// picked up: the use key talked to the vendor. Each frame the local player's list is put in
// order as if an item were between -1 (revives, level exits) and 0.
//
// Not a class swap of Item::UnitBehavior: vanilla pets find items by the exact class name
// (FetchUnitsWithBehavior without includeInherited, Behaviors/MiniPet.as:284), so a subclass
// would never be picked up by a pet.
