# gambler

A gambler NPC in the tavern. Talk to him to play higher-or-lower: pick a bet
(100 to 1M gold), flip; a higher card than the dealer wins the bet, lower loses
it, a tie returns it. Bets you can't cover are greyed out, and a flip you can no
longer afford (after a loss) is refused with "Not enough gold" on the result line.

- Spawned by `HWPGamblerModule` at the tavern's table once the tavern is built
  (server only; the unit is netsynced and replicated to clients).
- The gambler comes back after a building upgrade, which rebuilds the town and
  destroys him; the module notices within a second and spawns him again
  (`HWP::Town::Kept`; test: `mod-town-rebuild`).
- Game logic in `scripts/HWP/Gambler/GamblerShop.as` (`HWPGamblerShop` /
  `HWPGamblerMenu`), GUI `gui/hwp_gambler.gui`, card sprites under
  `gui/hwp_gambler/cards/` (53 generated 32x64 PNGs).
- Bets are settled locally for the betting player (`GiveMaterial`), like any
  town shop.

His **Sell** button buys your wares (`HWP::Market`): crops and herbs for gold,
fish for bet tokens (1 / 3 / 5 per 1 / 2 / 3-star fish). The tokens line
under the reroll row shows how many you have, and so does a red chip cell
(`gui/hwp/token.png`) first in the materials tab's Supplies section (core
`HWP::Materials` section a, which this module titles; cell `hwp-mat-bet-tokens`,
`HWPTokenMaterial`); it hides while you have none.

The tokens are this module's (`scripts/HWP/Gambler/Tokens.as`: `bet_tokens` per
character, `HWP::Gambler::Tokens`, `AddTokens`, `SpendTokens`). It registers them as
core's market currency (`HWP::Market::SetCurrency`), so wares priced in tokens pay
tokens; without this module they sell for gold. `hwp tokens [n]` (cheat, needs
`e_cheats 1`) shows or adds them.

## Test checklist

1. `python -m gamelab run mod-gambler --mode lab`: no script errors; `[HWP:gambler] spawned the gambler in the tavern`
   once a town with a tavern is entered (not in the main menu).
2. Solo: interact, every bet button only selectable when affordable, flip
   animates, gold changes match the result text, Reshuffle resets.
3. Co-op (2 players): the client sees one gambler (no duplicate), can play, and
   only the client's gold changes.
4. `python -m gamelab run mod-supplies-tokens --mode lab`: `hwp tokens 7`
   (cheat), then the materials tab's Supplies section shows the chip with 7
   (the `menu` verb scrolls it into view and reads the count).

## Gear reroll

The Gambler also rerolls equipment: pick one of your seven equipped slots with
the `<` / `>` buttons and pay **2000 gold x item level** (ilvl 20 = 40,000) to
regenerate the item's modifiers. The base item, quality, item level, upgrade
level and colours stay; the modifiers (and so the name) are rolled fresh by the
vanilla `Equipment::Generator::ModifyItem(..., clearMods=true)`, so the result is
exactly what the item could have dropped as. A low item level has a small
modifier pool, so a roll can match what the item already had; a reroll rolls
up to 8 times for a different set (`REROLL_TRIES`). Legendary, unique, quest and
cursed gear can't be rerolled (the row shows them as "can't be rerolled"). The new item is sent to the other players with the vanilla
`PlayerEquipmentEquip` message, same as equipping it.

Test: equip a rare, note its mods, reroll at the Gambler (gold drops by
2000 x ilvl, name/mods change, character sheet updates); try it with no gold
(refused; the line under the cards names the price, and stays until the next
hand or bet, as do the reroll and sale messages). **Token reroll:** the second button pays 1 bet token
per 5 item levels (ilvl 1-5 = 1, 6-10 = 2, ...) instead of gold; with too few
tokens it is refused with the price. In co-op the other player sees the new item in your
character inspect.
