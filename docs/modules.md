# Module conventions

Each module is a folder `mods/<id>/` that is itself a valid unpacked HoH2
mod (`info.xml` at the root). `tools/build.py` packs it to `dist/HWP-<id>.bin`.

```
mods/<id>/
  info.xml                      name / author / description
  module.json                   build metadata: requires, overrides, exclude, local, local_only
  README.md                     the feature spec: what it does, how to test it
  scripts/HWP/<Feature>/*.as    all code under scripts/HWP/ to avoid base collisions
  res/language/english/hwp_<id>.lang
  gui/hwp_<id>_*.gui
  tweak/hwp/<id>_*.sval
  actors/..., items/..., prefabs/...   new units/data, never same path as a base file
```

## Rules

1. **Never shadow a base file unless declared.** A file at the same path as a
   base-game file replaces it wholesale. If a module must do that, list the
   path under `overrides` in `module.json`, keep a pristine copy next to it as
   `<path>.orig`, and `tools/build.py --check` will flag when a game update
   changes the original. One owner per overridden file across all modules.
2. **Prefer hooks, modules and class swaps** (module.json `class_swaps`; info.xml classmaps are ignored by the engine). See `docs/hooks.md`.
3. **Server authority.** Anything that changes shared state (gold, items,
   spawns) runs on the server (`Network::IsServer()`); clients request.
   Netsynced units can only be produced by the server.
4. **Save data** goes under the `hwp` key of the player or town record via the
   `PlayerRecordSave/Load` and `TownRecordSave/Load` hooks, so vanilla saves
   stay valid with the mod removed.
5. **Namespaces.** Script code lives in `namespace HWP` (or `HWP::<Feature>`);
   hooks live in `namespace HWP<Feature>` because the hook name must match the
   function name, not the namespace.
6. **Logging** goes through `HWP::Log("<module>", msg)` so lines are greppable
   as `[HWP:<module>]`.
7. **Language strings** use keys prefixed `hwp.<module>.`.
8. **IDs.** HashString ids, char flags and material keys are prefixed `hwp_`.
9. **Per-level setup** goes in `Start(StartMode)` of `HWP::ModuleStart`
   (`class X : Module, HWP::ModuleStart`), never in `Module::Load`: the engine
   skips `Load` whenever a level starts without a save (StartMode StartGame,
   e.g. a new profile's first town). Core's `GameModeStart` hook calls `Start`
   on every gameplay level, after the host spawned its players. Script
   globals reset with every level; what must happen before `PostStart` (or
   while the scene loads) goes in the module constructor, which runs once per
   level. State that must survive a level change lives in the player / town
   record (`HWP::SaveData`) or `GlobalCache`.

## Testing a module

GameLab replaced `dev_link.py` / `dev_check.py` (see README.md and `docs/MODDING_NOTES.md`).
A module is tested by a scenario under `gamelab/scenarios/`, run hidden and muted:

```
python -m gamelab run <scenario> --mode lab
```

- The fixture recipe (`gamelab/fixtures/<name>.json`) lists the mods to enable in
  `binary_edits.enable_mods`.
  - `gamelab/hps.py` writes them into the lab save as `HashString(id)`. No first-boot
    learning is needed: the hash is computed (`python gamelab/hps.py hash <id>`).
  - The lab game dir links every mod in `environments.json` `gamelab.mods`. A module
    joins by being added there and to a fixture.
- The run fails on a non-zero game exit or a failed assertion.
  - Scenario steps can assert on `[GL]` probe replies.
  - Script errors stay in `logs/pass<n>.HWR2.exe.log`; asserting on them is not
    automated yet.
- The old `dev_check --level` floor loader is replaced by the `gamelab-hands` verb
  `mission <id> [floor]`. `mods/devtools` was deleted at P7 (2026-10-17).
- Multiplayer behaviour still needs the manual checklist in the module's README, solo
  and in a 2-player lobby.

**Local content.** A module may hold files generated from the player's own
HoH1 install (`tools/import_hoh1.py`): they are listed under `local` in
`module.json`, gitignored, and `build.py` skips them unless `--with-local`
(for a personal build; never upload one). `import_hoh1.py campaign` deletes
and rebuilds its output folder on every run, but only when the folder carries
its `.hwp-generated` marker (or with `--force`).

A `local_overlay` prefix (`module.json`, e.g. the classes module's
`hoh1art/`) is local content that replaces committed placeholder files:
with `--with-local`, `hoh1art/players/hwp/thief/icons.png` is packed as
`players/hwp/thief/icons.png` instead of the committed placeholder. Without
it (and in unpacked dev links) the placeholders are used.

**Beta-only content.** A `local_only` module with `beta_into: "<host>"` (the
`holylocal` module, the Priest without the Celestial Ruins DLC, into `core`)
is never built on its own: `build.py --beta` (`deploy.py modded-prod --beta`)
packs its files into the host's `.bin`, so a beta tester enables only the
usual modules, and a build without `--beta` never carries them. Verified by
`mod-holylocal-priest` (the Priest offered, selected and created in character
creation with holylocal) and `mod-holylocal-priest-control` (no Priest without).

The main menu loads the town level and constructs every `Modules::Module` subclass,
but only gameplay modes tick `UpdateFrame` (measured 2026-10-17, `docs/RE_NOTES.md`).
Put boot-time self-checks in the module constructor; a `log_has` step sees them.
Anything that needs a player needs the manual checklist in the module's README, solo and
in a 2-player lobby for anything networked.
